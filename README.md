# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

**Short answer mechanic**:  
You click on an answer cell, which turns **selected** for a second. Then it shows if the answer was **correct** or **wrong**. If correct, you either move on to the next question or continue choosing more answers if the question requires it (indicated by a number in parentheses). If you pick a wrong answer, you lose immediately. You cannot restart the game or navigate to the start/finish screens until you win or lose.
